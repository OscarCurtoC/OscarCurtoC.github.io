									<h3>«Correction of a user’s physical position in an immersive virtual reality environment»</h3>
								</header>
								<p>This undergraduate dissertation was born from the study «Follower Behavior in a Virtual Environment», where the user has to perform different tasks in a virtual environment that simulates a train station. After a while carrying out those tasks, the emergency alarm of the train station starts to rang. In any case the purpose of the study is to analyze both the behavior of the participants and their interactions with the non player characters (NPCs) of the virtual environment. The goal of my undergraduate dissertation is to solve the issues caused by the navigation system used, Walk in Place. Such system entails that the participant can travel long distances in the simulation raising and lowering the legs, realizing the act of walking without moving from the original position. However the issue within WiP is that people make small displacements meanwhile immersed in the virtual reality therefore appearing a risk of collision. That effect is caused because using the virtual reality equipment the user sees how the avatar walks and unconsciously it reproduces those steps in real life. This project oversees different methods in order to select which solution would be the best. The final solution consists in programming the behavior of the non player characters to perform specific actions, with the purpose of repositioning the user avoiding collisions with the physical environment, ensuring its safety. A key part of this dissertation is to conserve the realism pursued by virtual reality environments, in a way that the behavior of the non player characters are not incoherent and conserve the immersive experience of the user. Finally in order for this work to be developed it will be required knowledge of the Unity platform, the language C# in addition to virtual reality studies.</p>
